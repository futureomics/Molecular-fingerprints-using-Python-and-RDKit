# Molecular-fingerprints-using-Python-and-RDKit
Molecular fingerprints are binary or count vectors representing a molecule's presence or absence of particular substructures or chemical features.

They're used in:

1.Similarity searching (e.g., Tanimoto similarity)

2.Clustering

3.Machine learning models for property prediction

üõ†Ô∏è Common Types of Fingerprints in RDKit
1.Morgan Fingerprints (also called circular fingerprints, e.g., ECFP)

2.MACCS Keys

3.Topological fingerprints
